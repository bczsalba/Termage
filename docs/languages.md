In order for `Termage` to support more languages, PyTermGUI must support two things for each:

- Executing their code
- Wrapping the output of their STDOUT

The first problem is mostly solved already; there seem to be plenty of ways to execute both interpreted and compiled languages, it just needs to be implemented. The second part, however, is a bit more of a hangup. It is likely very possible to implement, and if there is enough interest in it I might try to do so.
