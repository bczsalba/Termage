Usage You simply call termage with some code, and provide options to customize the output. By default, the output file will be printed to STDOUT, but you can export directly to a file using the -o flag. Termage also accepts having code piped to it; this sets the code argument to - , which will cause it to read from STDIN. Showcase source.py import pytermgui as ptg with ptg .

Include Includes a file within a codeblock. The file path must originate from the same directory as mkdocs.yml . For example, let's say we have the following structure: mkdocs.yml docs/ index.md src/ intro01.py intro02.py To include intro01.py into a Termage block within index.md , you could use: ```termage include=docs/src/intro01.py print(\"Code from the original codeblock is retained!\") ``` Info The include option will always \"prefix\" the actual codeblock's value with whatever is included. As such, if docs/src/intro01.py had the content: print ( \"Included text will always preface the real value of a codeblock\" ) Termage will parse the block as: ```termage <options> print(\"Included text will always preface the real value of a codeblock\") print(\"Code from the original codeblock is retained!\") ``` Hide lines The plugin has a special bit of syntax to signify Run this line of code, but don't display it . It is denoted by prefacing any hidden line with an ampersand (&): Source ```termage title=Hidden\\ lines &from pytermgui.pretty import print print(locals()) ``` Python Output print ( locals ()) Width and Height Sets the terminal's dimension of the given axis.

This has some advantages: Your screenshots will always remain up to date I know from personal experience how draining it can be to go through all images in your documentaition, see if they need to be replaced, re-create the original screenshot with the right settings & size and upload it to your site. Termage simplifies this by basically doing all of that for you, every time your docs need to be updated. You are always going to test some parts of your function. Some errors, even in well-traversed codepaths may be very hard to catch. By putting your raw output straight into your documentation, you ensure that as many people see it as possible. This hugely increases the chance of finding issues that no one would have reported for weeks. You have a good opportunity to write some visual example code! The easiest way to work with the plugin is to keep a set of source code files, and use the include option to display them on the page. By doing so, you offer some really good \"getting started\" material to newcomers to your project, and ensure that it is fully functional! Set up In order to use the plugin, you need to enable the following built-in markdown extensions: mkdocs.yaml markdown_extensions : - attr_list - pymdownx.superfences - pymdownx.tabbed : alternate_style : true Additionally, you must also activate the plugin: mkdocs.yaml plugins : - termage Warning Make sure to put this plugin in front of any other markdown pre-processors. This helps cut down on unintended, and hard to debug behaviour. Usage The plugin will look for the syntax: ```termage(-svg) option=value option=value... {code} ``` All possible options can be found on their page . There are 2 directives possible: termage <options> : Generates a tabbed layout, with one tab for the Python source, and the other for the SVG output. Example ```termage title=Tabbed\\ layout include=docs/src/source.py ``` Python Output import pytermgui as ptg with ptg . WindowManager () as manager : manager . layout . add_slot ( \"Body\" ) manager . add ( ptg . Window ( ptg . inspect ( ptg . inspect ), box = \"EMPTY\" , ), ) termage-svg <options> : Generates only the output SVG, without the tabbed layout.
